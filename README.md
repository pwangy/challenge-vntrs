# VNTRS React coding challenge
This is my work for VNTRS' code challenge.

Objectives
  1. Recreate the Careers page as defined in the provided example.
  2. Fetch career data from API to populate the page.
  3. Choose at least 2 goals from the subtask list to enhance the page.
  4. Turn in the challenge 24 hrs before the next interview.

### Subtasks
x Set up dynamic routing and link the job's to separate pages where you display the job data.
x Make the page look great on all screen sizes (we all love responsive webpages)
- Add some custom styling to impress us with CSS (or preprocessor) knowledge
- Add an icon button to toggle the view between a grid list in the initial design and an image slider (the design of this one is up to your imagination)
- Add a pop-up that opens when the user clicks on the "Help" button in the bottom right corner. The Pop-up should include a form with email and text input where a user can send us a message (you don't need to send any requests but try to set it up the way that that would be as easy to add as possible)

## Approach
I started off with an ambitious goal of tackling three of the subtasks listed (responsive web, dynamic routing, and modal/pop-up) but ended up with only 1.5 done.

Once the Career page displayed a list of mapped listings, I moved on to fleshing out styling and really differentiating how the site should render across different devices. For example: mobile the navigation menu shows only the hamburger and logo, tablet shows all three components, and desktop only the logo and text links appear. Navigation and number of jobs listed in a row were two big items I wanted to make sure had different definitions across devices. On top of this font sizing also scales depending on each device.

At this point I was running short on time and wanted to submit my work on time. I had started working on dynamic routing but wasn't able to complete this task without going over time and decided clean up and push what I had to review. It was important to meet the deadline which allowed this potential employer to have enough time to review so that we could have a meaningful chat about it.

As an aside: GitLab is something I was learning during this code challenge so there was a small learning curve here too.

If I had more time, I would figure out why the dynamic routing isn't quite working and then add the modal contact form.

I hope this work becomes the basis for a productive conversation.
